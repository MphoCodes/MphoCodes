Full-Stack Engineer | Mobile & Backend Systems | Scalable Architecture

## Overview

I am a full-stack engineer focused on building scalable, production-ready systems across mobile, web, and backend environments.

My work spans Android applications, server-side architecture, database design, and cloud-integrated systems. I approach engineering from a systems perspective — emphasizing separation of concerns, modular design, performance, and long-term maintainability.

I am particularly interested in building platforms that operate reliably at scale, where architectural decisions matter more than surface-level implementation.

## Technical Scope

### Mobile Engineering

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- MVVM / MVI
- Clean Architecture
- Modular Android design
- Structured concurrency with coroutines
- State-driven UI systems

Experience includes:
- Dynamic screen rendering architectures
- ViewModel-driven state modeling
- Rotation-safe UI handling
- Recomposition optimization
- Domain-layer use case orchestration

---

### Backend & API Systems

- Node.js
- Express
- RESTful API design
- Authentication & session management
- JWT & secure cookie strategies
- Repository pattern
- DTO mapping
- Database abstraction layers

Focus areas:
- Clear API contracts
- Decoupled business logic
- Idempotent request handling
- Secure authentication flows
- Scalable service structure

---

### Databases & Data Modeling

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Firebase
- Relational schema design
- Index optimization
- Transaction handling
- Data normalization vs denormalization strategies

I prioritize data integrity, performance, and predictable query behavior.

---

### Web & Frontend Systems

- React
- Next.js
- Vue
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Engineering emphasis:
- Component isolation
- State management discipline
- API integration patterns
- Performance optimization
- SSR vs CSR tradeoffs
- Clear folder architecture

---

### Cloud & Infrastructure

- AWS
- Docker
- CI/CD pipelines
- GitHub Actions
- Environment configuration management
- Deployment workflows

I focus on reproducible builds, controlled environments, and operational reliability.

## Systems Thinking

I design software with these principles:

- Business logic should not depend on frameworks.
- State should have a single source of truth.
- Modules should communicate through contracts, not assumptions.
- Systems must evolve without structural rewrites.
- Security should be designed, not patched.
- Performance considerations begin at architecture level.

---

## Selected Project Domains

- Healthcare platforms with structured appointment workflows
- Logistics systems with booking and operational tracking
- Infrastructure service platforms with real-time interactions
- Mobile SDK-style modular flows
- Full-stack booking and payment systems

Across these domains, I have worked on:

- End-to-end feature implementation
- API consumption and integration
- Domain-layer modeling
- UI-state synchronization
- Backend orchestration
- Deployment and production hardening

---

## Current Direction

- Deeper systems architecture
- Advanced concurrency models
- Scalable backend design
- Cloud-native application structure
- Platform engineering mindset
