# Mpho Ndlela

Full-Stack Engineer building scalable systems across mobile, web, and backend.

I care about architecture.

Not just getting things working, but making sure they continue working when the system grows, when requirements change, and when other engineers join the codebase.

I’ve worked across Android, backend services, databases, and web platforms. Most of what I build revolves around structured systems: clean layering, predictable state management, and clear separation between business logic and UI.

I like codebases that make sense six months later.

## What I Work With

Mobile:
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- MVVM / MVI
- Clean Architecture
- Coroutines & Flow

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- REST APIs
- Authentication systems

Frontend:
- React
- Next.js
- Vue
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

Cloud & Tooling:
- AWS
- Docker
- CI/CD
- GitHub Actions

## The Kind of Problems I Enjoy

- Designing modular mobile systems
- Building dynamic UI flows driven by domain models
- Structuring backend services so they don’t collapse under growth
- Modeling data properly instead of patching it later
- Aligning frontend and backend contracts cleanly
- Reducing complexity through better boundaries

I think a lot about:

- State ownership
- Idempotency
- Concurrency safety
- Recomposition control
- Dependency direction
- How to prevent rewrites

---

## Projects I’ve Worked On

- Mobile flows that dynamically render screens from structured models
- Booking platforms with payment integration
- Logistics systems with operational tracking
- Healthcare portals with structured workflows
- Full-stack platforms deployed end-to-end

Most of my experience sits at the intersection of product and architecture — where decisions actually shape long-term velocity.

## Where I’m Heading

Becoming a stronger systems engineer.

Going deeper into:
- Platform design
- Scalable backend architecture
- Advanced mobile modularization
- Cloud-native thinking
- Cross-platform architectural alignment
